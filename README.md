# Maleria-Detection

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to detect malaria from cell images. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a given cell image is infected with malaria or not, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Introduction :
Malaria is a serious disease that affects millions globally, primarily in tropical regions. Early detection and diagnosis play a crucial role in treatment. This project leverages machine learning and image processing to classify cell images as either infected or uninfected.

Features :
Preprocessing cell images to enhance model performance
Model training using convolutional neural networks (CNN)
Evaluation metrics for classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Visualization of results and model predictions

Model Training and Evaluation :
This project utilizes a CNN architecture, fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Model evaluation includes metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Future Work :
Testing with different model architectures
Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
Deployment of the model as a web or mobile application
